# Contributing to Adobe Cloud Platform XDM Machinery

The XDM Machinery project is an Open Development/Inner Source project and welcomes contributions from everyone at Adobe.

## Things to Keep in Mind

The XDM Machinery project uses a **commit then review** process, which means that for approved maintainers, changes can be merged immediately, but will be reviewed by others.

For other contributors, a maintainer of the project has to approve the pull request.
