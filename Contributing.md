# Contributing to Adobe Cloud Platform XDM Machinery

The XDM Machinery project is an Open Development/Inner Source project and welcomes contributions from everyone at Adobe.

## Things to Keep in Mind

The XDM Machinery project uses a **commit then review** process, which means that for approved maintainers, changes can be merged immediately, but will be reviewed by others.

For other contributors, a maintainer of the project has to approve the pull request.

# Before You Contribute

* Check that there is an [existing issue](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ACP%20AND%20component%20in%20(%22machinery%22)) in the ACP project
* Check if there are other pull requests that might overlap or conflict with your intended contribution
* If there is no issue, and no prior work, send a short mail to [Grp-XDM-API-WGs](mailto:Grp-XDM-API-WGs@adobe.com) with the subject line `[XDM][Machinery] Contribution â€¦`

# How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a pull request
3. Submit the pull request

In your pull request, outline,

* What the change intends to do
* How it changes the existing code
* If (and what) it breaks
* Start the pull request with the JIRA issue ID, e.g. ACP-123


Each commit message:

* Should contain the issue tag like `[ACP-123]`
* Can contain the tag `[trivial]` for trivial changes that don't relate to an issue

# How Contributions get Reviewed

One of the maintainers will look at the pull request within one week. If you haven't heard back from the maintainers within a week, it is not impolite to send a reminder to [Grp-XDM-API-WGs](mailto:Grp-XDM-API-WGs@adobe.com).

Feedback on the pull request will be given in writing, in GitHub.
